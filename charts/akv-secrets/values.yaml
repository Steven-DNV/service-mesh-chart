  #     - name: # name of the k8s secret to create
  #       # # There are two ways of importing secrets from AKV.
  #       # # 1) Import secrets with the same name of data keys as secrets in AKV.
  #       #  akvSecrets: [] # list of names of secrets in AKV to import, data keys with the same names will be created in kubernetes secret. 
  #       # # 2) Use the form below if you need to import secrets under dataKeys with different names. Useful if you need to adjust naming convention on the fly. 
  #       # # e.g. you need UNDERSCORES_IN_NAMES but keyvault doesn't allow underscores in secret names.
